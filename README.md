# Minimum Wage Analysis

### Description: 

In August 2021, I had a cousin living at home with us. She had always thought about moving to Washington, she argued that Washington was financially a much better state to live in. However, my dad argued that California was a better state to live in because the minimum wage was higher. This eventually evolved to a family debate. My visiion for this project was to end the debate once and for all.

### 1. Gathered and imported data into SAS dataset

During the intial stages of my project, I gathered data about minimum wage, average salary, and average cost of living for each state in the US. The information used for this project was taken from paycor.com, ziprecruiter.com, and mit.edu respectively. From here, I created a SAS dataset for each statistic.

### 2. Merged and Sorted datasets for analysis using SAS

Using SAS, I merged and sorted the datasets for further analysis. Below is an image of a portion of the code used to manipulate the datasets I created. I have also attatched the entire code as a pdf.

### 3. Produced PDF Report of Data using SAS

After completing all of my code, the end result is an 8 page pdf detailing each table organized and labeled for easy analysis. Below is one of the tables produced and the pdf with the full results

### 4. Drew Meaningful Conclusion from data analysis

During my analysis I realized that my cousin was in fact right. From the image above, we can conclude that a minimum wage worker in Washington is better off than a minimum wage worker in California because they can work less hours to meet their cost of living. But I did not want to end it there. I wondered if living in California was better for a worker making the average california salary instead of minimum wage. The table below is the one I produced to answer this question.

The results were clear. A washington worker making the average salary will be able to save more money after accounting for average cost of living. While washington ranked 11 on this scale, California ranked 48: one of the worst. 

## In every aspect, the clear winner was Washington. Washington simply offers a better bang for your buck.
